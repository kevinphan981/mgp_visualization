# Change Log with Dates

Created branch and input sample-data from another repo that has done something similar to us. Data was scraped from the site, courtesy of [j2kun](https://github.com/j2kun/math-genealogy-scraper/blob/main/data.json). Note, the data is old and is only to 2019-06-17. This is just a way to help me work on the actual content faster.

Made some basic code for the graph datastructure from json and the visualization into html. It kind of is balancing on a bunch of tooth picks, still has a lot of problems, but it is at least a first visual of what is going on in the data.

# Tasks
1. Figure out edge to node situation, possibly create class in order to include more details for the nodes
2. Figure out how to retrieve the year, I don't know how it's this hard
3. Figure out how to get the inputs (advisors) in the graph, possibly adding it to the existing edges code.
